# pihole-stats

pihole-stats consolidates statistics from **multiple Pi-holes** in an easy-to-use Android application.

## Why set up multiple Pi-holes?

It earns you a bit of redundancy. If you have two Pi-holes, you can reboot or otherwise fiddle with one of them without breaking DNS for your entire network.

## Why would I need an app for this?

The Pi-hole admin dashboard gives you a nice overview of DNS activity, but has no built-in support for handling multiple Pi-holes at once. Rather than opening a browser tab for each Pi-hole, this app aggregates the information into a single dashboard.

## Can I also control the Pi-holes?

At this time, the focus is on merely displaying the information. There are other projects that enable synchronization of settings between multiple Pi-holes.

Here are a few, in no particular order:
